> ### What are the default settings of the Bot?

The bot has `.` as default prefix and the following default welcome settings:
* `color_white` as a background
* `purr` as icon
* `hex:000000` as text colour
* `Welcome {mention}!` as message.

> ### The Bot constantly leaves when I invite it. What's wrong?

When \*Purr* leaves your Discord right after being invited, make sure to have DMs open because it will send a DM with the reason.  
The bot will leave with one of the following reasons:

> ```
> [Auto Leave] Your Discord is blacklisted! Join our Discord for the reason.
> ```

Your Discord got blacklisted by me (The Bot owner) for a specific reason.  
In most cases is the Discord blacklisted for being against Discord's ToS or against law (encouraging, promoting or supporting illegal activities).  
A primary example would be `x invites = reward` Discords which are against Discord's rules.  
You can always join the [Discord] to get the actual reason for the blacklisting.

> ```
> [Auto Leave] Your Discord has more bots than users.
>              Please reduce the amounts of bots you have
>              or invite more members.
> ```

This reason pretty much explains itself. \*Purr* leaves Discords, which have more bots than users.  
The easiest ways to fix this are mentioned in the reason.

> ### How do I use the welcome option?

See [[This page|Welcome channel]] for a tutorial.

----
> ### From where are the images?

We use our own API to provide own images.  
The reason behind this is to have more control over what is being shown.

We try our best to not depict any inappropriate images (e.g. NSFW lolis) but cannot guarantee this.  
If you encounter an image that could be seen against Discord's ToS and/or Community Guidelines, report it to us in our [Discord], or through e-mail at support@purrbot.site (Please provide the full image link in both cases).
