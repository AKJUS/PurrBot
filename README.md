This bot was made to use the [nekos.life]-API but moved to its very own API.

# Commands

**Default Prefix**: `p.`

The bot can have a different prefix on other Discord Servers.  
If You're not sure what prefix is used can you just mention the bot (`@*Purr*#6875`) and it will tell you what prefix is used. Alternatively can you also start the command with the mention instead of the prefix.

![mention]

A full list of all commands can be found on the [wiki][commands].  
All commands require the following permissions:  
- Read Messages
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Read Message History
- Add Reactions
- Use External Emojis

# Inviting the bot

To invite the bot with all the necessary required permissions mentioned in the [Commands Section](#commands) you can use this invitation link:  
> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=425382319449309197&permissions=379968&scope=bot%20applications.commands

If you want to add the bot without a pre-made role, use this link instead:  
> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=425382319449309197&scope=bot%20applications.commands

Note that when you add the bot without a pre-made role, you will need to give it one with the necessary required permissions.

## Note about Administrator permissions

The `Administrator` Permission is a dangerous one as it can allow bots to cause damage on your server with barely any way for you to prevent it (Except for kicking it).

To prevent such events from happening with \*Purr* does it not execute any commands while having the Administrator permission assigned.  
This is our way to protect your server from any possible harm.

We highly recommend to always have a dedicated Bot-Role which has the necessary permissions the bot requires and NEVER give Administrator permissions to any bot.  
If a bot can't work without this permission, search for a different one as this is not considered a good practice in Bot Development.
