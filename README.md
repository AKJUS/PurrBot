# Inviting the bot
The bot has two invite-links: A full invite and a basic invite.

## Full invite
The link for the full invite gives \*Purr* all permissions, to work properly and without any issues.
The permissions include:
- Managing messages: Will be used to delete certain commands of users like `.invite` or `.info`
- Adding reactions: Nothing really special. Just makes \*Purr*'s responses a bit different.
- Attach files: Used for the welcome-channel (`.welcome`), to create a image for the joined user.
- All permissions of the basic invite.

## Basic invite
The basic invite will only give the most necessary permissions for \*Purr* to work correctly.
This permissions are:
- See messages: Let \*Purr* see all channels, that don't have channel-specific permissions.
- See message history: Let \*Purr* see the message history of a channel.
- Send messages: Let her send messages.
- Embed Links: \*Purr* won't work without this permission!
