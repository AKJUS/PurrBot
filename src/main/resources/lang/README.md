## Translations
\*Purr* allows to have a per-guild language to be set.  
The language used can be set through the `.language` command (Default is english (en)).

## Contribution
You may add your own translation to the list, to be added into \*Purr*.  
To do this, follow those steps:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new language file as json (`<language>.json`) inside this lang directory.
3. Copy the content of the `en.json` into the newly created file and translate the messages.
4. Save the changes and PR them to the main repository.

## Important
- Do NOT remove, add or edit any placeholders (`{placeholder}`).
- Do NOT remove or edit any unicode. Unicode starts with `\u` (e.g. `\u2705` for âœ…)
