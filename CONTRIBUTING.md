# About
I (Andre601) as a developer are happy about any improvements towards my project, since I'm not an expert at developing stuff.  
That said, I still want people to follow common rules and code-designs.

Please read those CONTRIBUTING.md carefully, since not following the mentioned points will end in closing your issue and/or Pull request without any changes being made.

## Issues

### Before creating a issue
Please make sure, that you have those steps made, before opening a new issue:

> The bot has the required permission.

The bot requires `send messages`, `read channels`, `embed links` and `add reactions` permission for basic functionality.  
Those permissions are provided through the basic invite of the bot, that can be found in the README.md of this repository.

> You have the `manage server` permission

Some commands requires you to have the `manage server` permission.  
The bot won't perform those commands, when you lack this permission.

### Creating an issue
When creating an issue, make sure to select the right type of issue.  
For bug reports, use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/Andre601/PurrBot/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) template and for improvements and general feedback the [Feedback](https://github.com/Andre601/PurrBot/issues/new?template=feedback.md) template

Please follow the mentioned parts in the issue and provide the requested information, to receive the fastest response and help.

## Pull Request
I'm more than happy about any Pull Request, that improves the code of my bot.  
I do not have any requirements about what you have to follow in the Pull request, but I want you to at least follow the "style" I have in my code.
