# Translations
\*Purr* offers a way to have per-guild languages set, to customize her responses and make her feel more personal.

All the translations (except for english) are done by the community and we welcome any language, being it a real-lige one like `German`, or a made up one like `English OwO`.

If you want to contribute towards the translation of \*Purr*, follow the below steps.

## Step 1: Join the Discord
It is a requirement to be on tha [Nya~ Discord](https://purrbot.site/discord) as this is the main place to get notified about new or changed Strings that require translation.  
**You will be removed from the Translation Project, when you leave the Discord!**

## Step 2: Request being added
Once you're on our Discord Server will you next need to request getting added to the project.  
Depending on if the language already exists, or if it would need to be added first do you need to do one of two things.

### New language
> If the language you want to help translate already exists, go right to the [next step](#step-3-join-crowdin).

To get added for a new language, contact the Server owner Andre_601 (Andre_601#0601) on Discord and tell them, that you want to get added for a new language.  
He will then create the new language on the project and you can continue with the next step.

## Step 3: Join Crowdin
We host our translation project on Crowdin, which you can reach under https://lang.purrbot.site.

You have to login to your account, or create a new one. Next, go to the language you want to translate and click the `Join` button to request being added for it.  
If everything goes well, will you be added to the project.

## You're done!
You're now part of the project and can translate the text.  
Please note that we reserve the right to remove the language from our project page, if it seems to be inactive (Translations aren't made for a long time).
